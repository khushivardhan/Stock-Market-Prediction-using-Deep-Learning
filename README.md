# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning

Implemented a project on Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning models, specifically Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks, to accurately forecast future stock values. 

Executed and refined the model by integrating RNN layers within TensorFlow, incorporating LSTM and Dense layers with scaling and flattening techniques, achieving high precision and resolving complexities in the predictive model.
